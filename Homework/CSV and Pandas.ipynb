    "Working with CSV files is an essential skill for data analysis. I learned that it is very important to always observe your data after reading in a CSV file, as some files will have redundant or simply inneficient headers. For this CSV file in particular it was crucial to remove the header row as it provided confusing data by using unnamed variables (i.e Unnamed var 1, Unnamed var 2, etc...). Being able to access the data that is needed in an effective manner and in a way that is easily readable is also important. These are all skills that will be useful in any data analysis or data manipulation that may need to be done in the future."

I would have to say that the most challenging part in this assignment is remembering and reading over documentation in order to properly access column names and their indexes. Once I got the hang of the proper indexing methods it was very straight to forward to perform the necessary operations. It definetly involved a lot of trying different approaches before having to read the documentation for the proper syntax, especially since Jupyter notebook does not give warnings like an IDE. "

The fundamentals are the same for any data manipulation/traversal the same techniques can be used, the only thing that is different is the data. No matter the data that is provided it is always good practice to have a first few things that always happens accross any data set, this usually occurs in the reading and parsing of the data. As the manipulation techniques are basically the same however not all data sets are structured in the same manner. For me I always try to manipulate sets in a manner where I can almost achieve standardization that makes it that much easier to use the same techniques."
